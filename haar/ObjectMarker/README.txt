This directory contains the improved ObjectMarker program, a program to mark objects of interest in images.
This program was originally written using Visual Studio .NET, but now it's been made compatible with Linux as well.

To build on Windows, open ObjectMarker.sln using Visual Studio and build from there.
To build on Linux, type 'make'.
